## LESSON OBJECTIVES

1.  Describe the purpose of using R Markdown as a communication and workflow tool
2.  Incorporate Markdown syntax into documents
3.  Communicate the process and findings of an analysis session in the style of a report

## USE OF R STUDIO & R MARKDOWN SO FAR...

1.  Write code
2.  Document that code
3.  Generate PDFs of code and its outputs
4.  Integrate with Git/GitHub for version control

## BASIC R MARKDOWN DOCUMENT STRUCTURE

1.  **YAML Header** surrounded by --- on top and bottom

    -   YAML templates include options for html, pdf, word, markdown, and interactive
    -   More information on formatting the YAML header can be found in the cheat sheet

2.  **R Code Chunks** surrounded by \`\``on top and bottom     + Create using`Cmd/Ctrl`+`Alt`+`I\`

    -   Can be named {r name} to facilitate navigation and autoreferencing
    -   Chunk options allow for flexibility when the code runs and when the document is knitted

3.  **Text** with formatting options for readability in knitted document

## THE KNITTING PROCESS

-   The knitting sequence ![knitting](../lessons/img/rmarkdownflow.png)

-   Knitting commands in code chunks:

-   `include = FALSE` - code is run, but neither code nor results appear in knitted file

-   `echo = FALSE` - code not included in knitted file, but results are

-   `eval = FALSE` - code is not run in the knitted file

-   `message = FALSE` - messages do not appear in knitted file

-   `warning = FALSE` - warnings do not appear...

-   `fig.cap = "..."` - adds a caption to graphical results

## WHAT ELSE CAN R MARKDOWN DO?

## WHY R MARKDOWN?

\<Fill in our discussion below with bullet points. Use italics and bold for emphasis (hint: use the cheat sheets or `Help` →`Markdown Quick Reference` to figure out how to make bold and italic text).>

-   *here's some fun text*

-   **here's some other fun text**

## TEXT EDITING CHALLENGE

Create a table below that details the example datasets we have been using in class. The first column should contain the names of the datasets and the second column should include some relevant information about the datasets. (Hint: use the cheat sheets to figure out how to make a table in Rmd)

| Name      | Details                                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EPAir_O3  | Ozone and other Air Quality metrics in NC in 2018, we also had time series data  |
| ECOTOX    | Neonicotinoid Dataset - Chemicals and insecticides impact on wildlife            |
| NEON_NIWO | Niwot Ridge litter data set -- a survey of foliage and leaf litter and debris    |
| NTL-LTER  | Data from the Long Term Ecological Research center on the chemistry of two lakes |
| NWIS      | USGS National Water Information System for Nebraska water systems                |
| cb_2018   | shape data for the Nebraska Counties and NC counties                             |

## R CHUNK EDITING CHALLENGE

### Installing packages

Create an R chunk below that installs the package `knitr`. Instead of commenting out the code, customize the chunk options such that the code is not evaluated (i.e., not run).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("knitr")
```

### Setup

Create an R chunk below called "setup" that checks your working directory, loads the packages `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `knitr`, and sets a ggplot theme. Remember that you need to disable R throwing a message, which contains a check mark that cannot be knitted.
```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
getwd()
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(knitr)
library(extrafont)
library(extrafontdb)
library(hrbrthemes)


AmanfuTheme2 <- theme_ipsum()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "black"),legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
theme_set(AmanfuTheme2)
```

Load the NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw dataset, display the head of the dataset, and set the date column to a date format.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
NTL_LTER_Lake_Nutrients <- read.csv("Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_Raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
head(NTL_LTER_Lake_Nutrients)
NTL_LTER_Lake_Nutrients$sampledate <- as.Date(NTL_LTER_Lake_Nutrients$sampledate, tryFormats ="%m/%d/%Y")
```

Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but is not displayed in the final document.

### Data Exploration, Wrangling, and Visualization

Create an R chunk below to create a processed dataset do the following operations:

-   Include all columns except lakeid, depth_id, and comments
-   Include only surface samples (depth = 0 m)
-   Drop rows with missing data

```{r}
NTL_Nut <- NTL_LTER_Lake_Nutrients %>%
  select(!lakeid)%>%select(!depth_id)%>%select(!comments) %>%
  filter(depth==0.) %>%
  drop_na()
```

Create a second R chunk to create a summary dataset with the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of total nitrogen concentrations for each lake. Create a second summary dataset that is identical except that it evaluates total phosphorus. Customize the chunk options such that the code is run but not displayed in the final document.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
NTL_nut_Nitro <- NTL_Nut %>%
  group_by(lakename) %>%
    summarise(mean(tn_ug),min(tn_ug),max(tn_ug),sd(tn_ug))

NTL_nut_Phospho <- NTL_Nut %>%
  group_by(lakename) %>%
    summarise(mean(tp_ug),min(tp_ug),max(tp_ug),sd(tp_ug))
class(NTL_Nut$sampledate)
# 
# NTL_nut_Nitro
# NTL_nut_Phospho
```

Create a third R chunk that uses the function `kable` in the knitr package to display two tables: one for the summary dataframe for total N and one for the summary dataframe of total P. Use the `caption = " "` code within that function to title your tables. Customize the chunk options such that the final table is displayed but not the code used to generate the table.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(NTL_nut_Nitro,caption="Summary Statistics for Nitrogen, by Lake")
kable(NTL_nut_Phospho,caption="Summary Statistics for Phosophorus, by Lake")
```

Create a fourth and fifth R chunk that generates two plots (one in each chunk): one for total N over time with different colors for each lake, and one with the same setup but for total P. Decide which geom option will be appropriate for your purpose, and select a color palette that is visually pleasing and accessible. Customize the chunk options such that the final figures are displayed but not the code used to generate the figures. In addition, customize the chunk options such that the figures are aligned on the left side of the page. Lastly, add a fig.cap chunk option to add a caption (title) to your plot that will display underneath the figure.

```{r nitrogen,echo=FALSE,fig.align='left',fig.cap="Nitrogen Content By Lake Over Time"}
ggplot(NTL_Nut,aes(x=sampledate,y=tn_ug))+geom_step(aes(color=lakename))+labs(x="Day Number (Annual)",y="Total Nitrogen (micrograms)",title="Nitrogen Content By Lake Over Time")
```

```{r phosphorus,echo=FALSE,fig.align='left',fig.cap="Phosphorus Content By Lake Over Time"}
ggplot(NTL_Nut,aes(x=sampledate,y=tp_ug))+geom_step(aes(color=lakename))+labs(x="Day Number (Annual)",y="Total Phosphorus (micrograms)",title="Phosphorus Content By Lake Over Time")
```

### Communicating results

Write a paragraph describing your findings from the R coding challenge above. This should be geared toward an educated audience but one that is not necessarily familiar with the dataset. Then insert a horizontal rule below the paragraph. Below the horizontal rule, write another paragraph describing the next steps you might take in analyzing this dataset. What questions might you be able to answer, and what analyses would you conduct to answer those questions?

>So interestingly enough this dataset shows two reasonable amounts of data gathered over a year in a total of 8 lakes. Surface chemical readings were taken to measure phosphorus content as well as nitrogen content. We find in figures 1 and 2 how these values vary over time, with the x axis representing the date (the four digit code representing the year 19**, eg. 0092 is 1992) and the y axis being the lake nutrient content in micrograms. Given that there are large gaps in the data, and all of these were taken during summer months, we have these jagged bursts in the interstitial periods. 
*****
>The next things I would probably do are to take take a time series analysis approach, much like we did in A07, creating time series objects, filling in data gaps, and decomposing the data to look at the residual components. We'd be able to better understand if there's a cyclical nature to the trend, and if there is variation over time within each of these lakes. While we might expect some seasonality, we may come away surprised.

## KNIT YOUR PDF

When you have completed the above steps, try knitting your PDF to see if all of the formatting options you specified turned out as planned. This may take some troubleshooting.

## OTHER R MARKDOWN CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

We have covered the basics in class today, but R Markdown offers many customization options. A word of caution: customizing templates will often require more interaction with LaTeX and installations on your computer, so be ready to troubleshoot issues.

Customization options for pdf output include:

-   Table of contents
-   Number sections
-   Control default size of figures
-   Citations
-   Template (more info [here](http://jianghao.wang/post/2017-12-08-rmarkdown-templates/))
