## Things to know:
Not really too much, just make sure youre able to push to fork and pull from upstream main and upstream.

So apparently you cant have your personal access token in your commits, which makes sense. 
[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] is my personal access token, see [this video](https://duke.zoom.us/rec/play/ThB1xxqsBWMroLF8uuLr0CHPwvKun-3kKNkwiqWmPDweM-klqew3TGOW2GjEh0g31CZt35lJY7ykxeXg.S0QW7arYXX8zQTP1?startTime=1641840541000&_x_zm_rtaid=geKFuxDPSVG6kF0C5vpWXg.1642638001299.966594bd79cc48bd4697285d08cc9512&_x_zm_rhtaid=599):
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
